# About HackWashU2022:
This is our team project repository for the 2022 HackWashU coding event. Our project is WalkingTrees, an app that tracks user's carbon footprint using travel data obtained using Google Map API. We completed this project in 2.5 days. Our video presentation can be found here: https://devpost.com/software/walkingtrees.

# Files:
1. CO2_Tracker (folder)

(by Anton) Code for our app, written in Swift.
We discussed ideas for our app as a team. We conducted user testing by speaking to other participants in the hackathon, which informed our user interface design.

2. 2022 FE Guide for DOE-release dates before 8-2-2022-no-sales -8-1-2022public.xlsx

(by Archer) This is the fuel efficiency data we used to calculate carbon footprint per trip made on a vehicle.

3. HackWashU_Data.ipynb

(by Jason) I imported a dataset containing CO2 emissions by vehicle type from Kaggle. I store the data in a Pandas Dataframe, so they can be extracted in our app for calculation.

4. Object > CSV.ipynb

(Jiayi and Jason) Jiayi designed a framework for importing data from Google Maps API as objects. Jason converted the objects into a Pandas Dataframe so the data can be accessed easily by our app.
